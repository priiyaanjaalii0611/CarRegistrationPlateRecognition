# CarRegistrationPlateRecognition
Using Tensorflow and computer vision the project detects registration plate in a car.<br>
* The model can also detect realtime with the help of your webcam<br>
* The model is using ObjectDetection API of tensorflow for number plate detection<br>
* I have done transfer learning from pretrained model __*ssd_mobilenet model*__
* For the license plate dataset I have used a kaggle dataset whose image and annotaions are in the image folder<br>
* Trained in 6000 steps you can tune the model according to your needs and better accuracy
* This template can be used for any object detection model by making few changes in the code
